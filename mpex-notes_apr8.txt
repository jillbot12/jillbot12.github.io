MPEX

TO FIX:
- alignment of right nav when decision is made on labels
- incorporate ALL in toggling
- extra spacing between paragraphs
- extra padding randomly showing up

- slideshow weirdness itself
- slideshow affecting isotope on interior pages
- slideshow controls showing up on regular pages

- make arrow disappear when no more posts show
- how to make it work with project and resource pages

- janky upload system vs new wordpress vs new formats


TO CREATE:
- give weight to MAKE and LEARN in index (is this javascript/isotope/wordpress?)
- best format for LEARN slideshows (image on top? what if no image included default)
- better way for CP to add galleries (is it in fact as bad as it used to be given new WP upgrade?

- gravity forms 
- weighted relationship of projects and resources on main page
- random appearance of share cards
- search functionality (set up search page styles)




DISCREPANCIES:
- Projects now need a header image



ALERTS TO CP:
- intern time for content entry for Resource PDFs
- style with all posts having header image - do you want this? not set up in old posts and can be redundant where you already placed same featured image at top
- making sure captions are properly added

TERMINOLOGY
If we change it to “think, make, learn” then how do we refer to these in the pages for “previous and next”

Next in THINK
Next in MAKE
Next in LEARN

or change it all to simply “NEXT” and “PREVIOUS”

HELP FROM Lara:

Slideshow with Flickity:
- not always working, pictures get stuck
- first image great, next ones teeny
- seems to be affecting the Isotope gallery below, making one column


QUESTIONS FOR LARA:
- why when I sometimes try to comment stuff out in php does it not always work?

- existing video plugins seem to make the videos super small. i edited the plugin with CSS to make the max width 75% (to match the page alignment) which makes it more responsive as well, but this only worked for vimeo, not youtube

- images in posts are not responsive, after making them “large’ in the image settings (even though they mostly already were) I thought this was fixed but it doesn’t stay put. This works with images on PAGES but not in POSTS. I added height and width auto to the CSS, trying to figure out why it is not working with POSTS.

-weird extra spaces that are not showing on existing site within posts, but that get deleted then show up again, and don’t stay deleted until i remove them in the html window in wordpress cms.

- extra space added in general, fixing in the CSS but is this problematic? Left of the social icons in header for instance.


- removing Flickity controls from non-project pages
