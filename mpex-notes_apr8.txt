MPEX

TO FIX:
- alignment of right nav when decision is made on labels
- incorporate ALL in toggling
- slideshow weirdness itself
- slideshow affecting isotope on interior pages
- give weight to MAKE and LEARN in index (is this javascript/isotope/wordpress?)
- CMS for LEARN pieces
- best format for LEARN slideshows (image on top? what if no image included default)
- taking existing gallery attachments and sending to felicity
- better way for CP to add galleries (is it in fact as bad as it used to be given new WP upgrade?


ALERTS TO CP:
- intern time for content entry for Resource PDFs
- style with all posts having header image - do you want this? not set up in old posts and can be redundant where you already placed same featured image at top
- making sure captions are properly added

TERMINOLOGY
If we change it to “think, make, learn” then how do we refer to these in the pages for “previous and next”

Next in THINK
Next in MAKE
Next in LEARN

or change it all to simply “NEXT” and “PREVIOUS”

HELP FROM Lara:

Slideshow with Flickity:
- not always working, pictures get stuck
- first image great, next ones teeny
- seems to be affecting the Isotope gallery below, making one column


QUESTIONS FOR LARA:
- why when I sometimes try to comment stuff out in php does it not always work?

- why are images not appearing?

- it seems that the featured image is automatically appearing at the top of all posts, how do I remove this?

- large images in post body, looking stretched and seeming to have their own wp-oriented classes that are overriding the css I made “image.alignnone.size-large.wp-image-1567” // going back into the post and making sure “large’ was selected brought the image back into the proportions of the page.

- existing video plugins seem to make the videos super small. i edited the plugin with CSS to make the max width 75% (to match the page alignment) which makes it more responsive as well, but this only worked for vimeo, not youtube

- images in posts are not responsive, after making them “large’ in the image settings (even though they mostly already were) I thought this was fixed but it doesn’t stay put. This works with images on PAGES but not in POSTS. I added height and width auto to the CSS, trying to figure out why it is not working with POSTS.

-weird extra spaces that are not showing on existing site within posts, but that get deleted then show up again, and don’t stay deleted until i remove them in the html window in wordpress cms

- not finding the galleries that come with the PROJECT pages in the CMS
