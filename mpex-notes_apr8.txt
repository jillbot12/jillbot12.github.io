——————————————
TO FIX:
- alignment of right nav when decision is made on labels
- incorporate ALL in toggling
- extra spacing between paragraphs
- extra padding randomly showing up

- slideshow weirdness itself
- slideshow affecting isotope on interior pages
- slideshow controls showing up on regular pages

- make next/prev arrow disappear when no more posts show
- how to make next/prev work with project and resource pages

- janky upload system for galleries/attachments vs new wordpress vs new formats

- videos from Facebook not loading


——————————————
TO CREATE:

//SINGLE PAGES
- categories displays as bars
- better way for CP to add galleries (is it in fact as bad as it used to be given new WP upgrade?
- sidebar
	- for parts and tools on resource pages
	- for add your own on resource pages
- filter nav on every page, linking back to home 


//HOME PAGE
- give weight to PROJECTS and RESOURCES in index (is this javascript/isotope/wordpress?)
- random appearance of share cards
- search functionality (set up search page styles - like main page isotope?)



//RESOURCE PAGES
- best format for RESOURCE slideshows (image on top? what if no image included default)
- gravity forms 
	- Flickity slideshow within Gravity Forms





——————————————
DISCREPANCIES:
- Projects now need a header image


——————————————
ALERTS TO CP:
- intern time for content entry for Resource PDFs
- style with all posts having header image - do you want this? not set up in old posts and can be redundant where you already placed same featured image at top
- making sure captions are properly added

- random posts may need to be edited due to weirdness like Gowanus shellfish post




QUESTIONS:
- will you ever want to put slideshows in blog posts?





——————————————
MAIN TO-DOs with LARA

+ gravity forms (get the template designed ahead of time)
+ home page isotope
+ adding isotope to internal pages
+ adding next post/previous post functionality to additional pages
+ creating stage and real site
+ moving url etc.





——————————————
QUESTIONS FOR LARA:
- why when I sometimes try to comment stuff out in php does it not always work?

- existing video plugins seem to make the videos super small. i edited the plugin with CSS to make the max width 75% (to match the page alignment) which makes it more responsive as well, but this only worked for vimeo, not youtube

- images in posts are not responsive, after making them “large’ in the image settings (even though they mostly already were) I thought this was fixed but it doesn’t stay put. This works with images on PAGES but not in POSTS. I added height and width auto to the CSS, trying to figure out why it is not working with POSTS.

-weird extra spaces that are not showing on existing site within posts, but that get deleted then show up again, and don’t stay deleted until i remove them in the html window in wordpress cms.

- extra space added in general, fixing in the CSS but is this problematic? Left of the social icons in header for instance.


- removing Flickity controls from non-project pages
